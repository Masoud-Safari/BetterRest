# BetterRest: Personalized Sleep Recommendations

## Introduction

BetterRest is an innovative app developed as part of my learning path through the Hacking with Swift course. Utilizing machine learning, this app helps users find their ideal bedtime based on daily coffee consumption and desired wake-up time. The project was an exciting opportunity to delve into SwiftUI alongside Core ML, Apple's machine learning framework.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** Users input their desired wake-up time, how many hours of sleep they wish to get, and the amount of coffee they drink during the day. The app then calculates and suggests the optimal bedtime to ensure they wake up refreshed.
- **Technologies Used:** The app is built with SwiftUI for the UI components and integrates a Core ML model to analyze the user's inputs and predict the best bedtime. The machine learning aspect introduces a personalized experience based on the user's habits.

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The primary goal was to explore how to integrate machine learning models into iOS applications. This project provided hands-on experience with Core ML and how it can be used in conjunction with SwiftUI to create smart, user-focused applications.
- **Skills Gained:** Through BetterRest, I gained valuable experience in machine learning, data preprocessing, and SwiftUI. I also improved my understanding of user interface design and how to create intuitive, seamless app experiences.

## Acknowledgments

This project was built following the Hacking with Swift tutorial on SwiftUI. I would like to thank [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) for creating such a comprehensive and beginner-friendly guide to iOS development.
